                        The transcript comes from a spoken lecture and contains several missing words, marked by the placeholder `[blank]`.

                        These blanks were inserted where either:
                        - The original audio was masked by noise, resulting in a completely missing word, or
                        - The audio was transcribed incorrectly and then replaced by a blank.

                        Your task is to use the **context of the entire transcription** and any **domain-specific clues** 
                        (such as technical language or topic relevance) to accurately predict the most plausible word for each `[blank]`.

                        Important guidelines:
                        - Predict exactly **one word** per `[blank]` placeholder.
                        - However, you may predict **two words** if the **first word is an indefinite or definite article**, such as `"a"`, `"an"`, or `"the"` (e.g., `"a cat"`, `"the tree"`).
                        - Ignore any punctuation that appears near the `[blank]`. It may be incorrect due to audio corruption. Rely on sentence meaning and grammar to make your decision.
                        - Preserve the rest of the transcription exactly as it is, replacing only the `[blank]` entries.
                        - Your output should be a single string â€” the full transcription with predicted words inserted in place of the `[blank]` placeholders.
                        - use the entire transcription as a strong reference and the transcription's subject to determine the missing word.

                        ### Example (for format and reasoning only):

                        **Input:**  
                        "The tree is. [blank] Due to its height, it gets a lot of sunlight."

                        **Output:**  
                        "The tree is tall. Due to its height, it gets a lot of sunlight."

                        ---

                        Now complete the transcription by filling in the blanks.
